I received the Bachelorâ€™s degree in Software Engineering from [Ludong University](https://www.ldu.edu.cn/) in 2019, and the Master's degree in Computer Science from [Qufu Normal University](https://www.qfnu.edu.cn/) in 2021. 


> I am on the academic job market in the 2024-2025 cycle!



## Research Interests

My research agenda aims to build secure distributed systems. As such, my areas of expertise encompass **Cryptography** and **Distributed Computing**. I am particularly interested in Byzantine fault-tolerant consensus, blockchain, secret sharing, distributed key generation, and many other distributed protocols.
